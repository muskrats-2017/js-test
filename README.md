# Cards

Create a page that displays cards. Each card should have a title, a body and buttons to close or edit the card. We also need to have a form that allows users to add a card, setting the `title`, `body` and back ground color of new the card. Editing will alow the the user to change `title`, `body` and `background-color` of the selected card.

It is **required** to use jQuery and have a template for the cards.

It is **recommended** to use bootstrap and Mustache.

## Extra credit
Use the [`localStorage` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to make the cards persistent allowing them not to be lost when the page is refreshed.
